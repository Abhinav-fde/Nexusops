## 📌 Overview

As a network grows, manually verifying configurations, catching drift, and keeping backups current stops scaling. Engineers end up doing detective work — diffing configs by eye, hoping nothing slipped through.

**NexusOps turns that detective work into a pipeline.** It centralizes device inventory, configuration auditing, baseline compliance, backups, and automated remediation behind a single operations dashboard — so configuration drift is *detected and fixed*, not discovered during an outage.

> **Current status:** Simulation-based automation environment, fully functional end-to-end.
> **Next milestone:** SSH integration with virtual Cisco IOS devices for real configuration retrieval and deployment.

## ✨ Key Features

| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| 🖥️ **Operations Dashboard** | Real-time visibility into device inventory, availability, topology, compliance, and recent activity |
| ✅ **Compliance Engine** | Compares live device configuration against an approved baseline and calculates a compliance score |
| 📉 **Drift Detection** | Flags any configuration change that violates the approved baseline the moment it's audited |
| 🔧 **Automated Remediation** | Identifies missing commands and deploys the fix — no manual config-pushing |
| 💾 **Configuration Backups** | Timestamped, per-device backups, individually or in bulk |
| 📜 **Activity Tracking** | Every audit, deployment, and backup is logged and surfaced on the dashboard |
| 🔍 **Device Search** | Instantly filter devices by name, IP address, or platform |

### Drift Detection — example

```text
Router0
  Before drift  → Compliance: 100%
  Command removed from running-config
  After audit   → Compliance: 80%  |  Status: ACTION REQUIRED
```

### Automated Remediation — example

```text
Audit → Detect Missing Configuration → Fix Configuration
      → Deploy Required Commands → Re-Audit → 100% Compliance
```

                          Network Devices
```

The network-operations layer is deliberately decoupled from the API layer. That's what lets the current **Simulation Mode** be swapped for real SSH/Netmiko device communication in Phase 2 without touching the audit, backup, or deploy engines.

## 🔁 Example Compliance Workflow

A device's baseline requires:

```text
ip domain-name nexusops.local
ip ssh version 2
service password-encryption
```

If a required command is missing, NexusOps flags the drift:

```text
Router0
Compliance: 80%
Missing configuration detected
```

The remediation workflow restores compliance automatically:

```text
80% Compliance → Configuration Fix → Missing Command Applied
              → Re-Audit → 100% Compliance
```

---

## 🧪 Simulation Mode

The current build runs on a simulated device state so the full automation architecture can be developed and demonstrated without physical network hardware. Simulation Mode currently supports:

- Device inventory
- Configuration auditing
- Configuration drift
- Compliance scoring
- Configuration deployment state
- Configuration backups
- Activity tracking

This lets the API and automation workflows be validated independently of real infrastructure — before the SSH/Netmiko layer goes live in Phase 2.

## 🎯 Engineering Goals

NexusOps exists to explore the intersection of:

**Network Engineering × Backend Engineering × Automation × DevOps**

Rather than treating network management as a set of manual, one-off commands, this project models network operations as **programmable workflows** — exposed through a REST API and surfaced through a centralized dashboard.

---

## 🔒 Security

- Sensitive environment variables are excluded from version control
- The repository does not intentionally store production device credentials
- Real-device integration (Phase 2) will use environment-based credential management rather than hardcoded authentication

---

## 🔭 Future Vision

The long-term goal is to evolve NexusOps from a simulation-backed platform into a device-integrated network operations system capable of running the full loop —

```text
Observe → Audit → Detect Drift → Remediate → Verify → Backup
```

— across multiple real network devices, through secure automation protocols.
